# Analyzing-IPL-data-and-making-first-inning-score-prediction-model
<br> * In this file i have done a lot of data analysis related to IPL dataset from Kaggle
<br> * Along with that i have build a ML model predicting the first inning score in an IPL match 
<br> * For deployment of ML model,  Made a web app framework using Flask and for frontend, HTML web pages are created
<br> Note : The deployment and HTML web pages part is taken as a refernece from Anuj Vyas same [github project link](https://github.com/anujvyas/IPL-First-Innings-Score-Prediction-Deployment). I have just made small changes to make it usable for my project.
